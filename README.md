# Data Structures

This repository was created by me more for educational purposes, as I wanted to understand how some data structures work and are implemented.

## Here you can find the implementer of such data structures

- [AVL Tree](https://github.com/nazarslota/data-structures/blob/master/ds/avl-tree.h)
- [List](https://github.com/nazarslota/data-structures/blob/master/ds/list.h)
- [Vector](https://github.com/nazarslota/data-structures/blob/master/ds/vector.h)
